> # The following machine translation:

I am a newbie who loves the front end

GitHub allows me to better manage git repositories

I am slowly learning and sharing what I have learned

My project should be relatively boring and simple (*for me*)

But I love code and I'm proud of it

I look forward to the future I can better grasp the new knowledge

Learning does not stop, just as the times keep developing

For this reason, I have to constantly improve myself through learning

Stand out from it and make better technology
